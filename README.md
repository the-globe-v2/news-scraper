# Globe News Scraper

Welcome to the Globe News Scraper, a Python-based tool designed to efficiently scrape, process, and store news articles from various sources. This project is designed to run in a containerized environment and is capable of handling large volumes of data while ensuring robustness and resilience.


## Overview

The Globe News Scraper is a comprehensive news scraping tool that integrates multiple components for fetching, processing, and storing news articles from various sources. It uses a pipeline architecture that handles everything from data acquisition to database storage, ensuring that articles are scraped and processed efficiently.

- **Key Features**:
  - Scalable architecture designed for containerized environments.
  - Parallel processing of articles using thread pools.
  - Robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
  - Support for multiple news sources, with easy extensibility for future sources.

## System Architecture

### Deployment Architecture

The Globe News Scraper is designed for deployment in a containerized environment using Docker. The scraper can be scheduled to run periodically using cron jobs or similar scheduling tools.

### Data Flow

The data flow within the Globe News Scraper is managed by the `NewsPipeline` class, which orchestrates the fetching, processing, and storing of news articles.

- **Data Acquisition**: Handled by the `NewsPipeline` class, which coordinates with news sources to fetch articles.
- **Data Processing**: Articles are processed by the `ArticleBuilder` component, which validates and structures the data.
- **Data Storage**: Processed articles are stored in a MongoDB database using the `MongoHandler`.

For a detailed view of the components and their interactions, refer to the [System Architecture section](#system-architecture) in the documentation.

### Core Components

- **`NewsPipeline`**: Orchestrates the entire scraping process.
- **`ArticleBuilder`**: Handles the processing and validation of articles.
- **`MongoHandler`**: Manages the storage of articles in MongoDB.
- **`NewsSourceFactory`**: Manages the creation of news source objects.

Refer to the [Core Components section](https://mavial.notion.site/Globe-News-Scraper-95c5f9dfe79944599b63d719024a35df) for more details on each component, including key methods and performance considerations.

## Configuration

The Globe News Scraper uses a centralized `Config` class, built with Pydantic, to manage all configurations. The configuration settings cover various aspects of the application, such as logging, database connections, and scraping parameters.

- **Environment Variable Management**: Configuration values are automatically loaded from environment variables, with defaults set in a `.env` file.
- **Type Validation**: Ensures that all configurations are correctly typed and validated at startup.

For detailed information on configuration options and their usage, visit the [Configuration section](#configuration).

## Setup and Deployment

To set up and deploy the Globe News Scraper, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. **Run the scraper**:
    ```bash
    python ./main.py --env=dev
    ```

**Docker Setup**: The project is designed to run within a Docker container. A sample `docker-compose.yml` file is provided for easy deployment. The scraper can be scheduled to run periodically using a `crontab` file.

For detailed setup instructions and deployment options, see the [Setup and Deployment section](https://mavial.notion.site/Globe-News-Scraper-95c5f9dfe79944599b63d719024a35df).

## Logging

Logging in the Globe News Scraper is managed through a combination of Pythonâ€™s standard `logging` module and `structlog`. The logging configuration is flexible, allowing different formats for development and production environments.

- **Error Filtering**: The `WarningFilter` class prevents specific non-critical warnings from cluttering the logs.
- **Rotating File Logs**: Logs are stored in files with rotation to prevent excessive file sizes.
